# UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

- Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where algorithms analyze and interpret unlabeled data without explicit human supervision.

- It identify patterns in data sets that are neither classified nor labeled

- The primary goal is to uncover patterns, groupings, and differences in unstructured data

## Main Techniques in Unsupervised Learning

1. **CLUSTERING** 
   - Groups similar data points together based on similarity measures

   - Creates clusters where data points in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

   - Can be used to label data for subsequent supervised learning applications

2. **DIMENTIONALITY REDUCTION**
    - Reduces the number of features (dimensions) while preserving important information.

    - Simplifies complex, high-dimensional data for easier analysis and visualization.

    - Helps in addressing the "curse of dimensionality" problem.

   - Improves computational efficiency and model performance
3. **ASSOCIATION RULE MINING**
     - Discovers relationships between variables in large databases.

   - Identifies patterns of co-occurring items or events.

    - Commonly used in market basket analysis to understand purchasing behaviors

4. **ANOMALY DETECTION**
      - Identifies data points that deviate significantly from the norm.

   - Detects unusual patterns that don't conform to expected behavior.

    - Used in fraud detection, system health monitoring, and outlier analysis.

## Advantages of Unsupervised Learning

- Time Efficiency: No need to label data, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

- Raw Data Analysis: Allows scientists to tackle raw data and find patterns in datasets.

- Data Comparison: Helps determine the degree of similarity between groups of data using probabilistic approaches.

- Exploratory Power: Excellent for discovering unknown patterns and insights in data.

- Flexibility: Can handle various types of data and adapt to different problem domain

- Human-Like Learning: Somewhat resembles how the human brain learns, potentially yielding more realistic outcomes

## Disadvantages of Unsupervised Learning

- Longer Processing Time: May take more time to process all data due to lack of prior knowledge.

- Continuous Data Requirements: Complex projects may require ongoing data feeding as the project progresses.

- Complexity: Developing accurate models often requires complex implementations and advanced skills.

- Validation Challenges: Difficult to validate results due to the absence of ground truth labels.

- Interpretation Difficulties: Discovered patterns may be hard to interpret or explain.

- Less Predictive Power: Generally less accurate for specific prediction tasks compared to supervised learning.
