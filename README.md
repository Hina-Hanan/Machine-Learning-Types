# Machine Learning Types: Theory Notes
A comprehensive collection of theoretical notes on machine learning types, subtypes, and core concepts. This repository serves as a reference guide for understanding the fundamentals of machine learning.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains detailed notes on the four main types of machine learning:

- **Supervised Learning** - Including classification, regression, and time series forecasting algorithms

- **Unsupervised Learning** - Covering clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association techniques

- **Semi-supervised Learning** - Exploring methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data

- **Reinforcement Learning** - Detailing policy-based, value-based, and model-based approaches

Each section includes theoretical foundations, mathematical concepts, practical applications, and implementation considerations to provide a well-rounded understanding of machine learning methodologies.

## Who Is This For?
Perfect for students, researchers, and practitioners looking to strengthen their theoretical understanding of machine learning concepts. Whether you're new to the field or looking to refresh your knowledge, these notes provide clear explanations of essential machine learning principles.
